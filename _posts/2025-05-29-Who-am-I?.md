#My first post

**Hello to all reading this.**
This is my first blog post. On this blog I will post some tutorials here and there, tips&tricks and what I think will be usefull for beginners and intermediate programmers, or anybody that has the time to take a look at what I post.  

*First of all*, let me present myself. My name is Mihai and I am a CS student at an university in Bucharest, Romania. I started programming since I was in the 9th grade and I found it really fun and entertaining. In general, I really enjoy automating stuff, that's why you will probably see that I will post a lot of automation tutorials.  

Also, I will share here my projects and will also talk about how I prepare for interviews and what projects are to come in the future.

-As I stated-, this is my first blog so I don't have much experience with writing, well... writing in general, except documenting my projects :) .
